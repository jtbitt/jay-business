  I love to travel and get to know new countries, no doubt about it. So do my
  friends. The new food, all the novelty, and new places to check out, it's
  dope. But one of the biggest issues, while amusing at times, is that we don't
  always know what people are saying. Duolingo and apps like that are fun but it
  feels like a lot of the stuff you learn in them isn't that important for
  talking to people. Kinda feels like we should just cut out the bullshit and
  focus on the most popular words so we can communicate with people as quick as
  possible. I decided to build a mobile app to see if I could accomplish a
  working demo.
</p>
<p>
  Mafer (my girlfriend), my friend Jason, and I put our heads together to see
  what we could come up with. Jason had the initial idea so we analyzed his
  vision and he put together a wireframe. From there, Mafer did her work in
  building out a design from the wireframe and research and making it look
  pretty. Once she was done with her magic, that was when it was my turn to step
  in.
</p>
<p>
  When I was deciding how to build I wanted to leverage skills I already had
  (Javascript, React) and also to use one codebase for both Android and iPhone.
  Since I had no experience with React Native I decided to use Expo to get
  started as fast as possible. The goal was to make a working demo of the
  prospective product that was more built out than an MVP, so that meant having
  a database of lessons and authentication to control access to the content.
</p>
<p>
  Since I'm a Front-End developer, I try to optimize my time as much as I can
  when it comes to Back-End processes. The current tools available in the cloud
  to replicate these activities is unbelievable, so I went in that direction. I
  utilized Firebase first to authenticate users through Facebook, Google, and
  email. I found it somewhat tedious to implement for the first time on mobile,
  but once I figured it out it was pretty straightforward. Utilizing React hooks
  I was able to take care of the different authentication api calls.
</p>
<p>
  Following that up, I thought pretty hard when it came to the database. I
  really wanted to use the NoSQL Firebase database but it didn't seem to make
  sense for having organized lessons and cards. Really felt like a PostgresSQL
  relational database made much more sense. I didn't want to build out a server
  and put a database there so I used Hasura, which is a cloud PostgreSQL
  database. It gives you all the features of a relational database and generates
  RestAPIs and GraphQL so you can pull the data into your project. I created a
  specific role for authenticated users so they could pull the content from the
  app but then I had another problem, I needed each user to have a unique token
  to tap into the lesson content.
</p>
<p>
  I went back searching into the documentation to see how I could generate a
  token after the Firebase authentication and pass it to Hasura. What ended up
  being the solution necessary was to use Firebase cloud functions along with
  setting up several env variables to link Firebase with Hasura. The cloud
  function I created basically listened for authentication than would generate a
  hasura token and add it to the Firebase user object. Once the user was
  authenticated and sent to the lessons section, Apollo made a GraphQL query to
  Hasura while passing the token and pulled the lessons into the app from the
  cloud.
</p>
<p>
  This was all great but there was one last technical thing I needed to do,
  which was to load a set of flash cards whenever a lesson was selected. I also
  needed to have an audio file attached to each flash card that played the
  sound. Since I was already invested, Firebase Cloud Storage made a lot of
  sense to handle both of those things. I split up the audio files and image
  files and put them into the cloud then I put the corresponding file names into
  the database entry for each card. From there, I used more hooks to pull down
  the data, grab the media, and then merge them together into one flashcard
  object for each card. It ended up working out well.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I worked hard to make the UI look great, using CSS-in-JS and Flexbox
  for pretty much everything. I ended up getting it looking good on all mobile
  screens and really matching the design. Overall, I found building out a mobile
  app to be much more difficult than building a web app, but maybe it's because
  I have so much experience in web. I was really stoked to pull it off and we'll
  see where this project goes, we may try to do a kickstarter with it. Was a
  cool learning experience.
